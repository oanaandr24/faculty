A proof is a demonstration that some statement is true. We normally demonstrate proofs
by writing English sentences mixed with symbols.
We’ll consider statements that are either true or false. If A and B be are statements, then
“not A,” “A and B,” and “A or B,” are called negation, conjunction, and disjunction,
respectively. “not A” is opposite in truth value from A. “A and B” is true exactly when
both A and B are true “A or B” is true except when both A and B are false.

Conditionals: “if A then B” (or “A implies B”) is a
conditional statement with hypothesis A and conclusion
B. It’s contrapositive is “if not B then not A” and it’s
converse is “if B then A”. Statements with the same
truth table are said to be equivalent. The table shows
that a conditional and it’s contrapositive are equivalent.
A conditional is vacuously true if its hypothesis is false.
A conditional is trivially true if its conclusion is true.
Proof Techniques: We’ll give sample proofs about numbers. Here are some definitions.
• integers: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
• odd integers: ..., -3, -1, 1, 3, ... (have the form 2k + 1 for some integer k).
• even integers:..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ... (have the form 2k for some integer k).
• m | n (read m divides n) if m ≠ 0 and n = km for some integer k.
• p is prime if p > 1 and its only divisors are 1 and p.
